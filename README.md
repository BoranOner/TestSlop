It's a Bomb Rush Cyberfunk multiplayer mod. Skate around with your friends.

**WARNING:** This is a highly unstable mod with several bugs and crashes. I'm working on it as I can, but please don't expect things to be *too* stable.

**See the [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/SlopCrew/SlopCrew/blob/main/INSTALL.md) file for setting up the mod, or making your own servers.**

## Supported features

Slop Crew can sync:

- Character, movestyle, and outfits
- Player position, including across maps
- Boostpack/friction effects
- Animations & dancing
- Real time 1v1 score battles

## Connecting to a server

After install, Slop Crew will make a config file you can edit. The default server is hosted by me ([NotNet](https://n2.pm/)) in the eastern US.

After starting the game, open a save file, and other players will automagically appear in front of you. Have fun!
